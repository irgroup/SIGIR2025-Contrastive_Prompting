ocean remote sensing

Identify documents discussing the development and application of space-borne ocean remote sensing.

Documents discussing the development and application of space-borne ocean remote sensing in oceanography, seabed prospecting and mining, or any marine-science activity are relevant. Documents that discuss the application of satellite remote sensing in geography, agriculture, forestry, mining and mineral prospecting or any land-bound science are not relevant, nor are references to international marketing or promotional advertising of any remote-sensing technology. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) employed in ocean remote sensing is relevant.
