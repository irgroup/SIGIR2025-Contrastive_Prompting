computers and paralyzed people

How can computer technology improve the life of paralyzed people?

Relevant documents describe ways in which computer technology can improve the lives of people who are paralyzed, where the technology is either currently in use or is under development. Use of exoskeletons to help paralyzed people move is relevant, though other uses of exoskeletons are not relevant. Tests and studies on animals are not relevant if they don't show a direct link to human use.  Use of technology for persons with disabilities in general is also not relevant.
