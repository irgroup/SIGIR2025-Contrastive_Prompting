Health and Computer Terminals

Is it hazardous to the health of individuals to work with computer terminals on a daily basis?

Relevant documents would contain any information that expands on any physical disorder/problems that may be associated with the daily working with computer terminals. Such things as carpel tunnel, cataracts, and fatigue have been said to be associated, but how widespread are these or other problems and what is being done to alleviate any health problems.
