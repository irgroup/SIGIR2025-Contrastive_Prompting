eating invasive species

Would eating invasive species be a viable method of controlling/eradicating them?

Relevant documents identify invasive species in the U.S. that can be eaten by human beings and discuss the likelihood of controlling the species through consumption.  Comments on the color, taste, texture, or other culinary qualities of particular invasive species are also relevant.
