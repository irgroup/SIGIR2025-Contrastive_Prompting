You are a journalist assessing the relevance of news articles for the following topic and need to generate search queries to find as much relevant material as quickly as possible.

Queries should be as diverse as possible and avoid repetition and no more than 3 query terms.
Topic Title: "{topic_title}"
Topic Description: "{topic_description}"
Summary of documents, that were judged as relevant before: "{summarized_documents}"

Please use the summaries of the relevant documents to refine the queries, ensuring that the documents retrieved are similar to those in the summaries, thereby helping to focus on finding more relevant documents.
